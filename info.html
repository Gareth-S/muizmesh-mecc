<h2 style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"> Open Mesh Topology</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;"><a href="https://muizenmesh.co.za/map.html">Link to our mapbox</a> showing intended coverage, and the same <a href="https://muizenmesh.co.za/map2.html">view via openstreetmaps.</a></p>

<h2 style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">WiFi Nodes</h2>

<p style="font-family: courier;">WiFi means that the network will be accessible via your smartphone and will not require any Internet Data. The services currently being
  demonstrated via the cloud will be mirrored on local servers enabling you to upload and share images, share and remix your work, drop tracks 
  under a 'community mesh license' that aims to protects your copyright whilst promoting freedom. You can also create calenders and backup your diary using <a href=https://muizenmesh.co.za/cal/>BayCal</a>, our WebDav and CalDav server, enabling
  open-learning and free education. </p>

<p style="font-family:courier;">Suggested method of creating our mesh network:</p>

<p style="font-family: courier;">Repurposed routers, either flashed with <a href="https://openwrt.org">OpenWRT</a>, and/or used as base stations for Raspberry Pi servers.
</p>
<p style="font-family: courier;">For various reason, many of the old routers in South Africa will not be able to be flashed, but may be repurposed into our project. We will carry
  information on which hardware works as we move forward on our wiki. The goal is to either piggyback Raspberry Pi Zeros into the old boxes, or even create our own new boxes via 3D printing ABS or lazer cut plywood.</p>
  
<p style="font-family: courier;">Currently most routers have a USB port and may be setup to act as nodes.</p>

<h3>Nodes more Technical</h3>

<p style="font-family: courier;">The project is currently exploring various methods of generating mesh nodes, including deploying <a href="https://libremesh.org/">LibreMesh</a> which runs on the Batman protocol, or using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_(protocol)">Babel Mesh Routing protocol</a>,
  or returning <a href="https://frrouting.org">FFRouting</a> to its origins as <a href="https://www.quagga.net/">Quagga</a>, named after an extinct Zebra once found on the slopes of Table Mountain. We will also be experimenting with Virtual Public Network (VPuN) relays and even exit gateways.</p>
  
<p style="font-family: courier;">The <a href=http://www.tinc-vpn.org>Tinc project</a> provides a means of creating a VPN with meshing, as does <a href=https://meshbird.com>Meshbird</a>. 
  Other contenders, are <a href="https://github.com/ntop/n2n"></a>n2n</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NeoRaider/fastd/wiki">fastd.</a></p>

<h3>Connectivity</h3>
<p style="font-family: courier;">For obvious reasons, connectivity to the network will essentially be gratis to avoid having to apply for an ISP license. We do not intend
to become an ISP, but merely to offer a Community LAN / Mesh experience.</p>

<p style="font-family: courier;">If the community want to provide an alternative service, the suggested route is to open your router access to the general public or deploy a virtual gateway such as <a href=https://althea.net>Althea.</a>
</p>
<p style="font-family: courier;">Explore solutions such as <a href="https://bridge.markofthelam.com">Bridge to the Net</a></p> 

<p style="font-family: courier;"> We plan to offer various edge-hosted services, including <a href="https://bridge.markofthelam.com">Freedom Box</a></p>

<h2 style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Open Collective</h2>

<p style="font-family: courier;">Setting up as an <a href="https://opencollective.com">opencollective</a> or affiliating to an opencollective host is the preferred means of creating organisational transparency
whilst enabling the necessary fund-raising ability. Any ideas on this step would be appreciated.  If you wish to become a supporter, donate, or give of your time, please feel free.
The preferred method of support is donations running forward. You are free to pay a monthly donation of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want>whatever you can afford</a>, anywhere from R20-R100 per month, to cover our infrastructure costs, which though low, still cost money.
Please see Ko-Fi button, or you can just drop a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/DavidLewis546">PayPal Me</a></p>

<p style="font-family: courier;">Once we get more organised and collectively, decentralised, there will be an AGM and a NPO/CBO in which you may also participate.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Membership</h2>

<p style="font-family: courier;">Currently membership is restricted to the residents of Muizenberg and also interested parties. In future the community
will set its criteria for federating with other community projects for example <a href="https://www.inethi.org.za">iNethi</a> in Ocean View. We aim to be as
decentralised as possible while promoting an <a href="http://urbancommonscookbook.com">urban commons</a>. A single-sign-on SSO solution is being evaluated and will
enable members and users to sign-on from a single page and authorise with all the apps available via our network.</p>

<p style="font-family: courier;">Go ahead sign-up to our <a href="https://muizenmesh.co.za/chat">chat server</a> powered by rocketchat. We still need to build our onboarding system, so please be patient. The system is currently in Alpha Preview mode.
</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Milestones</h2>

<p style="font-family: courier;">The project is being managed via <a href="https://github.com/ubuntupunk">github</a> which has great project management tools including kanban. If you are a coder, please feel free to assist.</p>

<p style="font-family: courier;">In future we may want to create our own locally hosted version control system, using opensource tools. </p>

<p style="font-family: courier;"git>Key milestones include demonstration of a working node. Presentation to the community, mesh building workshops, hackathons and more.</p>
