    <h2>What's this?</h2>
    <p>
        A community of sites around a common topic, also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring">webring</a>. 
        Each member includes a badge on their site that links to the previous and next sites in the ring. 
        Websurfers in the 90s used to love it!
    </p>

    <h2>How to join</h2>
    <p>
        To join the webring, <a href="{{ meta.repo }}/compare">open a pull request</a>
